//1 Variables naming
//2 Profile being visited: openProfileId
//2 Logged in user: loggedInUserId

//1 Features to build:
//3 Header must not reload every time a navigation is made where header still stays on-screen. (Lazyloading React âœ“)
//2 Comments on all posts (should comment input field be visible by default?)
//2 - Ability to like and dislike comments
//2 An editable about page on Profile
//2 The Public page in general must be implemented
//2 The ability to add friends
//2 Option to have closed or open profile

//2 Regarding comments being visible:
//2 The comment input field could be visible by default, but to read comments, the comment button must be clicked
//2 Once a user has posted a comment, it'll instantly be visible.
//2 ? The next time the user loads the page where the comment is, it can either stay visible or disappear ðŸ¤”
//2 Comments should be sorted in order of when they were posted.
//2 Comments need a timestamp / datestamp
//2 ? Should your comments always show up on top for you? YouTube does that
